  <font size="5"><h2> <u> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY HEALTH AND WELL BEING?</u></h2></font>
  <FONT style="GOTHIC" ><font size="5">Health means a state in which a person's physical, emotional, mental, financial, and spiritual goals have been reached. Wellness is a journey to health. 
    <img src="C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\computer project 8th\intro.png"  align="right" height="400" width="400"><br>
    Wellness is my personal choice to take actions to honor my health needs in ways that are most sustainable and 
caring for me.Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.<br>
" An important implication of this definition is that mental health is more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.

Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote, interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and restoration of mental health can be regarded as a vital concern of individuals, communities and societies throughout the world.
