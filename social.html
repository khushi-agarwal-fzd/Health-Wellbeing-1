<font size=3>Social health is the aspect of overall well-being that stems from connection and community. It’s about having close bonds with 
family and friends, enjoying a sense of belonging to groups, and feeling supported, valued, and loved.To summarize decades of scientific
 studies, our relationships determine both how well we live and how long we live; connection is as vital to survival as food and water.
  For instance, research has shown that positive, satisfying relationships are one of the best predictors of health across the lifespan,
   whereas loneliness is more deadly than obesity. That’s why it’s helpful to distinguish social health as a distinct yet interconnected
 pillar of overall well-being.</font><img src="C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\computer project 8th\social.png" align="right">
 <h2><u>Impact of social health?</u></h2>
 <font size=3>Customs and traditions prevalent in a society influence all aspects of the lives of individuals, including their health and welfare.
  What people eat, how they eat, how they live and care for their own health as well as the health of their near and dear ones are 
  influenced by the prevailing customs and traditions. Let us first understand the meaning of the term custom.</font>
  <h2><u>What are social skills?</u></h2>
  <u>Here are five:-</u>
  <dl>
   <u> <dt>More and Better Relationships</dt></u>
 <dd>By developing your social skills you become more charismatic, a desirable trait . People are more interested in charismatic people 
as charismatic people are (or at least appear to be) more interested in them.Most people know you cannot advance far in life without 
strong interpersonal relationships. Focusing on relationships will help you get a job, get promoted and make new friends. Well honed 
social skills can increase your happiness and satisfaction and give you a better outlook on life.More relationships can also help to
 reduce the negative effects of stress and boost your self-esteem.</dd>
 <u><dt>Better Communication</dt></u>
 <dd>After all, you can not have great social skills without good communication skills and being able to convey one's thoughts and
     ideas may be the single most important skill that you can develop in life.</dd>
     <u><dt>Greater Efficiency</dt></u>
     <dd>Some people dread social interactions because they do not wish to spend time with individuals who do not have similar 
interests and viewpoints. It is a lot easier to attend a meeting at work or a party in your personal life if you know at 
least some of the people who will be there. If you are in a social situation and do not want to spend time with 'John' because you 
don't like him or he cannot help you with a particular issue, a good set of social skills will allow you to politely convey that you
 need to spend time with other people at the get together.</dd>
 <u><dt>Advancing Career Prospects</dt></u>
 <dd>Most worthwhile jobs have a 'people component' and the most lucrative positions often involve a large amount of time spent
 interacting with employees, media and colleagues.It is rare that an individual can remain isolated in their office and still excel in 
 their job. Most organisations are looking for individuals with a particular, tactical, skill set: the ability to work well in a team 
 and to influence and motivate people to get things done.</dd>
<u><dt>Increased Overall Happiness</dt></u>
<dd>Getting along and understanding people will help to open many personal and career-related doors.Having the confidence to start a 
conversation at a work-related conference may lead to a new job offer with a higher salary. A smile and 'hello' in a social
 situation may lead to a friendship being formed.</dd>
