<font size=3>Emotional health is one aspect of mental health. It is your ability to cope with both positive and negative emotions, which includes 
your awareness of them. Emotionally healthy people have good coping mechanisms for negative emotions, and they also know when to reach
 out to a professional for help.Emotional wellness is tied to physical health. People who experience great amounts of stress and 
 negative emotions will sometimes develop other health problems. These problems are not caused directly by the negative feelings, but
  by behaviors that negative emotions can influence due to a lack of emotional regulation. For example, some people enjoy smoking
   cigarettes or drinking alcohol as a way to relieve stress. However, those habits put you at a greater risk for cancer, heart 
disease, and other illnesses.</font><br> <img src='C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\computer project 8th\emotional.jpeg' align=right height="500" width="500">

self-esteem and positive feelings about yourself.<br><br>

 substances more than usual, and think about whether thereâ€™s an emotional cause for this.<br><br>

   doesn't need to be overly tough or intense. Just going for a walk or dancing around your house can help.<br><br></font>
