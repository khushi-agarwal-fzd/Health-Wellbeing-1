<font size=3>Spirit is what can not be defined as part of the body or as part of the mind. Body, mind, and spirit all have an affect on one and 
other. By improving your spiritual life you can contribute to the healing process. Spirituality may not be able to cure you, but it 
can help to cope with the pain and difficulties that accompany illness. Spiritual health is achieved when you feel at peace with life. 
It is when you are able to find hope and comfort in even the hardest of times. It can help to support you as you experience life
 completely. Spirituality is different for everyone.</font>
